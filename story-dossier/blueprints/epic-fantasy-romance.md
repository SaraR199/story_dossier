## author's_voice_and_writing_style

[**NOTE TO AUTHORS:** This section is intended to set a baseline for good prose output. You may adjust anything below as needed, or completely change it to your own existing writing style document. Be sure to follow snake_case formatting.]

### reader_experience_goal

**reader_experience_goal:** [Readers should feel immersed in an epic, awe-inspiring world full of magic, danger, high stakes, and mythic adventure. The narrative should blend wonder, suspense, and deep character investment.]

### overall_story_pov

**narration_style:** [Third Person Limited is standard, but First Person or Omniscient is possible. Choose single or multiple POVs, consistent throughout.]

**story_type:** [Linear, quest-driven, or episodic with ensemble cast; use clear signposting for time, POV, or location shifts.]

**pov_approach:** [Balance internal emotion with external stakes. Characters should reflect their cultural context, and reveal biases through action, observation, and limited introspection.]

**deep_pov:** [Filter through emotional and sensory experience; maintain some distance for mythic tone. Let voice and worldview shape how magic, landscapes, and conflict are interpreted.]

### baseline_prose_style

**clarity_and_conciseness:** [Prose should be vivid, evocative, and clear. Use concise language for action; allow richer, more ornate description for setting or magical moments.]

**description_approach:** [Engage multiple senses; ground the world with concrete details (weather, terrain, artifacts, food, clothing, magic). Avoid infodump—embed worldbuilding in action and dialogue.]

**dialogue_style:** [Dialogue should reflect class, race, region, or upbringing. Stylized speech is welcome but must be readable. Use natural action beats.]

**sentence_structure_variety:** [Mix short, sharp sentences for action with longer, flowing sentences for description or introspection. Avoid repetitive structure.]

**verb_choice:** [Prefer strong, active verbs; reserve passive for epic effect or formal tone.]

**pacing:** [Alternate fast-paced action scenes with slower, atmospheric or emotional beats. Keep paragraphs lean during combat or peril.]

**diversify_vocabulary_and_avoid_predictable_phrasing:** [Use vivid, setting-appropriate language. Avoid tired fantasy tropes and stock phrases; invent unique terms or names for setting-specific elements.]

**engagement_priority:** [Every scene should deepen world, escalate stakes, or reveal character. Avoid static exposition.]

**stylized_language_control:** [Allow for poetic or elevated prose in magic, prophecy, or mythic moments, but maintain clarity.]

**style_reference:** [Follow Chicago Manual of Style.]

**punctuation_preference:** [Standard punctuation; em-dashes only for emphasis or interruption.]

### core_voice_and_emotion

**voice_authenticity:** [Each POV should have a distinct voice shaped by culture, role, and backstory.]

**emotion_rendering:** [Show emotion through body, reaction, and interaction with the fantastical world—fear is a racing heart, not just "she was afraid."]

**flaws_and_growth:** [All main characters should have weaknesses and growth arcs—pride, doubt, loyalty, etc.—reflected in decisions and failures.]

**descriptor_cap:** [No descriptor (adjective, phrase, or metaphor) may appear more than three times per manuscript.]

### writing_limitations_and_goals

**avoid_clichés:** [List any banned phrases/tropes. See cliché guide.]

**vivid_language:** [Prompt for strong verbs, immersive details. See reference.]

**emotional_clarity:** [Instructions to slow down at key emotional beats. Reference examples.]

**internal_consistency:** [Reactions and logic must fit character voice/arc.]

**show_don't_tell:** [Prompt for emotion via body language, subtext, action. See deep POV guide.]

**strong_prose:** [Avoid filler/redundancy; keep prose tight.]

### scene_and_chapter_dynamics

**scene_opening:** [Open with action, discovery, or a strong emotion—orient reader to POV, setting, and stakes immediately. Never begin with generic weather or unanchored landscape.]

**scene_closure:** [End on a cliffhanger, choice, revelation, or raised stakes. Every scene should move the quest or character arc forward.]

**single_pov_per_scene:** [One POV per scene/chapter. Head-hopping discouraged.]

**transition_handling:** [Explicit cues for time, location, or POV changes; use scene breaks or chapter headers.]

## project_essentials
