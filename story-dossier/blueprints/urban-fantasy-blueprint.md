## author's_voice_and_writing_style

[**NOTE TO AUTHORS:** This section is intended to set a baseline for good prose output. You may adjust anything below as needed, or completely change it to your own existing writing style document. Be sure to follow snake_case formatting.]

### reader_experience_goal

**reader_experience_goal:** [In one sentence, describe how readers should feel while reading this Urban Fantasy book. Evoke immersion in a modern world with hidden magic, tension, and wonder.]

### core_prose_style_directives

**pacing_and_rhythm:** [How fast should the story feel? Are sentences generally short and direct (for action, thrillers) or longer and more descriptive (for literary, fantasy, historical)?]

**level_of_detail:** [How much description should there be? Do we focus only on details that are critical to the plot, or do we linger on sensory information (sights, sounds, smells) to build atmosphere?]

**diversify_vocabulary_and_avoid_predictable_phrasing:**  [Use a broad range of accessible vocabulary to avoid repetitive or overused phrases. However, language should match the genre conventions and, unless specified by the character voice, language should be simple, active and logical. This keeps the writing fresh and engaging while maintaining the unique voice of each character.]

**action_vs_introspection:** [What is the balance between what a character *does* and what a character *thinks*? Is this a story driven by external action or internal reflection? (e.g., 70% action/dialogue, 30% internal thought).]

**Language Formality:** [Is the language simple and modern, or more formal and stylized? Limit stylized language, metaphors, or genre-specific flourishes unless project or author style demands.]

**show_don’t_tell:** [Emotion must be shown through dialogue, physical actions, environmental interaction, and sensory details. Avoid lengthy explanations of what characters are feeling or thinking about their feelings. If a character is angry, show them slamming a door or speaking in clipped sentences, don't explain their anger management philosophy.]

### core_voice_and_emotion

**voice_authenticity_directive:** [All descriptions, metaphors, and observations must be things the POV character would realistically notice or think. Their profession, mood, and past experiences must dictate what they see and how they describe it. Only include information from shared scenes/experiences in previous chapters that are externally observable.]

**emotion_rendering:** [Express emotion through body language, visceral sensations, and layered sensory detail that advances plot or insight. Show emotion through: (1) dialogue and what characters choose to say or NOT say, (2) physical actions and body language, (3) environmental interaction, (4) sensory details filtered through emotion.]

**banned_tropes_and_phrases:** [A simple, bulleted list of specific clichés or phrases to avoid. e.g., "- 'breath he didn't know he was holding', - 'shivers down his spine', - mustache-twirling villains, - info-dumping butlers."]

### pacing_and_scene_dynamics

**the_opening_rule:** [Open with immediate relevance—dialogue or action first, with POV and emotional stakes established through what characters DO and SAY, not what they think. If internal thought is used for orientation, limit to one sentence maximum. Never start with generic weather, clock, or sun/moon references.]

**the_closing_rule:** [End scenes on a hook: unresolved question, sharp emotion, or brewing consequence. Mini-cliffhangers are good. Move the story forward with every closure.]

**single_pov_per_scene:** [Maintain one clear POV per scene or chapter; never head-hop. Only include info from shared scenes/experiences in previous chapters that are externally observable.]

**scene_momentum_priority:** [Start scenes mid-action or mid-conversation whenever possible. Use dialogue to reveal backstory, emotion, and character development. Show relationship dynamics through banter, interruptions, and subtext. Action beats should advance plot or reveal character; avoid filler actions. Internal thought should react to external stimuli, not replace it.]

**the_momentum_rule:** [Every scene must maintain forward momentum. Cut any paragraph that could be summarized as "Character thinks about their feelings." Instead, have them DO something about their feelings—make a phone call, storm out, kiss someone, throw something, start baking aggressively, etc. Every scene must move the story forward. If a scene doesn't reveal new information, advance the plot, or develop a character's arc, it should be cut.]

### information_control

**the_information_silo_rule:** [This is the master directive for maintaining strict Point-of-View integrity. The AI will adhere to the 'Default Operating Principle' at all times unless a specific exception is defined below. Use the 'Allowable Exceptions' field to account for any unique genre elements like psychic links, magical bonds, or other forms of non-sensory information transfer.]

**default_operating_principle:** [Each POV character is a strict 'information silo.' They can only process information acquired through their own senses or explicit, on-page communication.
- **No Telepathy:** The POV character CANNOT know the internal thoughts, feelings, or intentions of another character, only observe their external actions and make assumptions.
- **No Clairvoyance:** The POV character CANNOT know events happening simultaneously in another location unless they are witnessing it through a medium (e.g., a video screen, a phone call).
- **Information Must Have a Source:** All knowledge must have a clear, on-page point of entry.]

**allowable_exceptions_and_overrides:** [List any and all story-specific exceptions to the default principle here. Be explicit about the 'how' and 'what.' If this field is empty or says 'None,' the AI will assume a strict, realistic information model.
*Examples:*
*- Fated Mates Bond: MC1 can feel MC2's physical pain and extreme emotions (fear, rage) but not their specific thoughts.*
*- Psychic Link: The twins can share surface thoughts and images, but only if both are concentrating. It is not an open channel.*
*- Prophetic Visions: The Oracle character receives cryptic, sensory-only visions of the future during sleep. They are never literal.*]

**pov_filter_directive:** [The AI is forbidden from inserting details or descriptions that the POV character would not realistically notice, care about, or have the knowledge to understand. A character's focus must always be dictated by their immediate situation, emotional state, and personal background.
*Example:*
*- A botanist might notice a rare poisonous flower in a garden; a soldier would see the same garden as a field of fire with poor cover.*]
