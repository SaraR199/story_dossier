Generated initial story concepts based on user inputs.

- `02-character-concept.md` - Protagonist, love interest, and supporting cast
- `03-world-concept.md` - Magic system, setting, and supernatural society

## Phase 2: Validation (Completed)

Validated consistency across all story sections and resolved contradictions.

**Validation results**: All issues resolved. Story concepts are internally consistent.

**Status**: Story validated and ready for integration enhancement.

---

## Phase 3: Integration (Completed)

Enhanced story cohesion by making all sections amplify each other.

**Character integration**: Rooted Mara's photography in unconsciously mapping Veil weak points; her abandonment in Commission Revelation Prohibition; Kieran's 1692 Salem founding trauma driving rigidity; their suspiciously perfect magical compatibility raising conspiracy questions.

**World integration**: Made ward magic require emotional vulnerability (directly challenging Mara's control issues), established Veil's rigidity as structural failure (making Kieran's binding specialty part of the problem), added Portland iron saturation weakening fae investigators, created thematically resonant weak points embodying character wounds, established cultural fated bond pressures and truth-bound investigative complications, and made resonance amplification require mutual emotional openness for tactical effectiveness.

**Final assessment**:
- **Cohesion Rating**: 8/10
- **Key Strengths**: Ward magic requiring emotional vulnerability brilliantly tortures Mara while serving vulnerability theme and connecting to Veil crisis.
- **Issues Found**: None - consistency maintained, strong amplification between sections.
- **Overall**: Excellent integration with concrete amplification across all sections. Character flaws organically interact with world rules (Mara's emotional guardedness vs ward authenticity requirement; Kieran's binding specialty contributing to Veil rigidity problem). Characters feel native to THIS specific world with backstories rooted in Portland geography, Commission history, and factional politics. Strong thematic resonance throughout all layers. No contradictions introduced during integration.

**Status**: Story dossier complete! All files in `lightweight/` directory.
